# CS305_Module_5

For this project we are creating code that will allow us to create a chess board and create a simple bot that will play along as the other side. We will be using C language to create this as it is one of the most commonly used programs for artificial intelligence.

## Getting Started

What you will need for this project include:

### Visual Studios or some other C language editor
### GitHub

## Testing code

Once finished with the code, compile the files in your command prompt and then run the main driver file.
