# CS305_Module_5

For this project we are creating code that will allow us to create a chess board and create a simple bot that will play along as the other side. We will be using C language to create this as it is one of the most commonly used programs for artificial intelligence. It will learn from the player to make moves depending on success in the past or if it lead to pieces being taken.

## Getting Started
